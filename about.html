        <h2>Digital Water Pipeline Management System</h2>
        <p>
            Our project is designed to help municipal workers efficiently track, manage, and maintain water pipelines in a given geographical area. 
            With the use of advanced prediction models and a user-friendly interface, we aim to improve the accuracy and speed of pipeline damage detection.
